# Statistics of the natural input to the visual system (Straub & Rothkopf, submitted)
This repository contains code for reproducing the results from our paper. It consists three main parts.

## 1. Simulating virtual agents
Given the positions and orientations of a human participant, the notebook [VirtualAgents](https://github.com/dominikstrb/imgstats-frontiersin/blob/main/Virtual-Agents.ipynb) creates viewing directions of the three virtual agents (straight, down and random) used in the paper. The results are saved in `data/virtual-agents`.

## 2. Retina projection

## 3. Image statistics
